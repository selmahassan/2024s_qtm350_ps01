# Project Housing For All

## Introduction

Housing costs across the United States are rising at exponential rates. The number of unhoused people in the U.S. is rising as a result. At the same time, private contractors and construction companies are still creating luxury housing rather than affordable housing options for people. These construction companies would rather profit from these luxury housing prices than help the less fortunate. 

### Why?
To create more affordable housing so people are able to live, we can turn buildings with many empty units into affordable housing. Nearly 1 in every 10 homes in America were vacant in the 2020 Census. Commercial buildings for offices also have high vacancy rates ever since the pandemic. For example, in Downtown Atlanta, GA, some office buildings have vacancy rates of over 40%. To better use land, resources, and energy that went into building these units, we can turn them into affordable places for people to live in. This solution will reduce the amount of homeless people on the streets and allow them to focus on finding job opportunities.
