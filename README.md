# Project Housing For All

## Introduction

Housing costs across the United States are rising at exponential rates. The number of unhoused people in the U.S. is rising as a result. At the same time, private contractors and construction companies are still creating luxury housing rather than affordable housing options for people. These construction companies would rather profit from these luxury housing prices than help the less fortunate.
