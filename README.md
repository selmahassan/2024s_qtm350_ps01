# Project Housing For All
Members: Selma Hassan, Vivan Liu, and Ayesha Saeed
## Introduction

Housing costs across the United States are rising at exponential rates. The number of unhoused people in the U.S. is rising as a result. At the same time, private contractors and construction companies are still creating luxury housing rather than affordable housing options for people. These construction companies would rather profit from these luxury housing prices than help the less fortunate. Our Project wants to collect all the vacant housing units in the United States to forecast the trends as to why these are vacant and compare them to current unhoused housing price increases to find a way to turn these vacant residents into homes for the unhoused.

### Why?
To create more affordable housing so people are able to live, we can turn buildings with many empty units into affordable housing. Nearly 1 in every 10 homes in America were vacant in the 2020 Census. Commercial buildings for offices also have high vacancy rates ever since the pandemic. For example, in Downtown Atlanta, GA, some office buildings have vacancy rates of over 40%. To better use land, resources, and energy that went into building these units, we can turn them into affordable places for people to live in. This solution will reduce the amount of homeless people on the streets and allow them to focus on finding job opportunities. 

## Method
By collecting data from real estate websites such as Zillow, Trulia, and RedFin, we can check housing prices along with when a property is bought and sold. We can look at data from quarterly reports and transactions from real estate companies to find buildings that are not being sold or used. Finding properties that are underutilized spaces can help us allocate certain areas for affordable housing. Using machine learning algorithms, we can track these changes and get real-time data.

We ran into merge conflicts a few times while editing, but we were able to resolve them.
